# The METAFONTbook

This repo contains my METAFONT responses to exercises as described in Donald Knuth's ["The METAFONTbook"](https://ctan.org/pkg/mfbook?lang=en)

## Tools

- `mf filename.mf` will compile a METAFONT file, returning a `.\d+gf` file
- `gftodvi filename.\d+gf` will convert a compiled METAFONT file into a DVI
